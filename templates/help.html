    <h2>About the Platform</h2>
<p>
    This platform is designed to assist in the preliminary screening for B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) by analyzing blood smear images. Using advanced deep learning algorithms, the platform categorizes blood smear images into four classes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Benign (non-leukemic)</li>
    <li>Early Pre-B</li>
    <li>Pre-B</li>
    <li>Pro-B</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These categories help in the early detection and differentiation of leukemia types, facilitating timely medical intervention.
</p>

<h2>How to Use the Platform</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Upload Image:</strong> Upload a clear image of a blood smear slide. Ensure that the image is in a compatible format (JPEG, PNG) and meets the platform's quality guidelines.</li>
    <li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Click "Analyze" to begin processing. The platform will analyze the image and provide results within a few seconds.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpret Results:</strong> Once processing is complete, results will display the category assigned to the image (e.g., Benign, Early Pre-B, Pre-B, or Pro-B).</li>
    <li><strong>Further Guidance:</strong> If the results indicate a potential malignancy, please consult a medical professional for a detailed diagnosis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding the Results</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Benign:</strong> Indicates that no leukemia cells are detected in the uploaded sample.</li>
    <li><strong>Early Pre-B, Pre-B, Pro-B:</strong> These labels represent various stages of B-cell development associated with B-ALL. If any of these categories are detected, it is recommended to seek further medical advice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What does this tool provide?</strong> This tool offers preliminary insights by classifying blood smear images into specific categories relevant to leukemia. It does not replace professional diagnosis.</li>
    <li><strong>Is my data secure?</strong> Yes, any uploaded images are processed securely, and privacy protocols are in place to protect user information.</li>
    <li><strong>What if my image quality is low?</strong> Clear, high-resolution images are essential for accurate analysis. Please re-upload if image quality does not meet platform guidelines.</li>
</ul>
